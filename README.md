## About

Voak's design (and name) is strongly inspired by [Oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak), the most popular web framework for [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). [Oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak) is itself inspired by [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa)/[Koa Router](https://github.com/koajs/router), a popular web framework for [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node). [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa)/[Koa Router](https://github.com/koajs/router) are themselves made by the team that made [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), the most popular web framework for [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node).

Because of this strong web framework design experience I decided to strongly imitate Oak's API.

For the code itself, `server.v` logic was inspired by [Vweb](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/master/vlib/vweb) and [Vex](https://github.com/nedpals/vex), big thanks.
